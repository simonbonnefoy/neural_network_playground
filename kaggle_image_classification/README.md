#kaggle image classification
[Kaggle to work on image classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ganeshmundra/classification-of-images).
In this challenge, I attempt to create an image classificator using a basic model with tensorflow. 

It seems that the model is overfit, and the results are not optimal. 
Next step to improve the classification is to use transfer learning from a keras trained model.
